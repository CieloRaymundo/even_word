# Even Word
Given that an "even word" is a word in which each character appears an even number of times, write a function that takes in a string and returns the minimum number of letters to be removed to make that string an even word.

```python
even_word('aaaa') == 0
even_word('potato') == 2
even_word('aabbbb') == 0
even_word('aaabbbccc') == 3
```

## Directions
0. Fork and clone this lab
1. Implement the `even_word` function in `even_word.py` such that all your tests pass.
2. Open a PR
